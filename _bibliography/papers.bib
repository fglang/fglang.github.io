	abstract = {Purpose An end-to-end differentiable 2D Bloch simulation is used to reduce T2 induced blurring in single-shot turbo spin echo sequences, also called rapid imaging with refocused echoes (RARE) sequences, by using a joint optimization of refocusing flip angles and a convolutional neural network. Methods Simulation and optimization were performed in the MR-zero framework. Variable flip angle train and DenseNet parameters were optimized jointly using the instantaneous transverse magnetization, available in our simulation, at a certain echo time, which serves as ideal blurring-free target. Final optimized sequences were exported for in vivo measurements at a real system (3 T Siemens, PRISMA) using the Pulseq standard. Results The optimized RARE was able to successfully lower T2-induced blurring for single-shot RARE sequences in proton density-weighted and T2-weighted images. In addition to an increased sharpness, the neural network allowed correction of the contrast changes to match the theoretical transversal magnetization. The optimization found flip angle design strategies similar to existing literature, however, visual inspection of the images and evaluation of the respective point spread function demonstrated an improved performance. Conclusions This work demonstrates that when variable flip angles and a convolutional neural network are optimized jointly in an end-to-end approach, sequences with more efficient minimization of T2-induced blurring can be found. This allows faster single- or multi-shot RARE MRI with longer echo trains.},

	abstract = {Purpose To extend the concept of 3D dynamic parallel imaging, we developed a prototype of an electronically reconfigurable dipole array that provides sensitivity alteration along the dipole length. Methods We developed a radiofrequency array coil consisting of eight reconfigurable elevated-end dipole antennas. The receive sensitivity profile of each dipole can be electronically shifted toward one or the other end by electrical shortening or lengthening the dipole arms using positive-intrinsic-negative-diode lump-element switching units. Based on the results of electromagnetic simulations, we built the prototype and tested it at 9.4 T on phantom and healthy volunteer. A modified 3D SENSE reconstruction was used, and geometry factor (g-factor) calculations were performed to assess the new array coil. Results Electromagnetic simulations showed that the new array coil was capable of alteration of its receive sensitivity profile along the dipole length. Electromagnetic and g-factor simulations showed closely agreeing predictions when compared to the measurements. The new dynamically reconfigurable dipole array provided significant improvement in geometry factor compared to static dipoles. We obtained up to 220\% improvement for 3 × 2 (Ry × Rz) acceleration compared to the static configuration case in terms of maximum g-factor and up to 54\% in terms of mean g-factor for the same acceleration. Conclusion We presented an 8-element prototype of a novel electronically reconfigurable dipole receive array that permits rapid sensitivity modulations along the dipole axes. Applying dynamic sensitivity modulation during image acquisition emulates two virtual rows of receive elements along the z-direction, and therefore improves parallel imaging performance for 3D acquisitions.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A framework for supervised design of MR sequences for any given target contrast is proposed, based on fully automatic acquisition and reconstruction of MR data on a real MR scanner. The proposed method does not require any modeling of MR physics and thus allows even unknown contrast mechanisms to be addressed.
Methods: A derivative-free optimization algorithm is set up to repeatedly update and execute a parametrized sequence on the MR scanner to acquire data. In each iteration, the acquired data are mapped to a given target contrast by linear regression.
Results: It is shown that with the proposed framework it is possible to ﬁnd an MR sequence that yields a predeﬁned target contrast. In the present case, as a proof-of principle, a sequence mapping absolute creatine concentration, which cannot be extracted from T1 or T2-weighted scans directly, is discovered. The sequence was designed in a comparatively short time and with no human interaction.
Conclusions: New MR contrasts for mapping a given target can be discovered by derivative-free optimization of parametrized sequences that are directly executed on a real MRI scanner. This is demonstrated by ‘re-discovery’ of a chemical exchange weighted sequence. The proposed method is considered to be a paradigm shift towards autonomous, model-free and target-driven sequence design.},

Data evaluation is computationally expensive, vulnerable to artifacts, and often sensitive to fit algorithm parameters. In this work, we investigate whether neural networks can provide not only fast model fitting results, but also a quality metric for the predicted values, so called uncertainty quantification, investigated here in the context of multi-pool Lorentzian fitting of CEST MRI spectra at 3T. Methods A deep feed-forward neural network including a probabilistic output layer allowing for uncertainty quantification was set up to take uncorrected CEST-spectra as input and predict 3T Lorentzian parameters of a 4-pool model (water, semisolid MT, amide CEST, NOE CEST), including the B0 inhomogeneity. Networks were trained on data from 3 subjects with and without data augmentation, and applied to untrained data from 1 additional subject and 1 brain tumor patient. Comparison to conventional Lorentzian fitting was performed on different perturbations of input data. Results The deepCEST 3T networks provided fast and accurate predictions of all Lorentzian parameters and were robust to input perturbations because of noise or B0 artifacts. The uncertainty quantification detected fluctuations in input data by increase of the uncertainty intervals. The method generalized to unseen brain tumor patient CEST data. Conclusions The deepCEST 3T neural network provides fast and robust estimation of CEST parameters, enabling online reconstruction of sophisticated CEST contrast images without the typical computational cost. Moreover, the uncertainty quantification indicates if the predictions are trustworthy, enabling confident interpretation of contrast changes.},

Methods Highly spectrally resolved Z-spectra from the same volunteer were acquired by 3D-snapshot CEST MRI at 3 T and 9.4 T at low saturation power of B1 = 0.6 µT. The volume-registered 3 T Z-spectra-stack was then used as input data for a three layer deep neural network with the volume-registered 9.4 T fitted parameter stack as target data. Results An optimized neural net architecture could be found and verified in healthy volunteers. The gray-/white-matter contrast of the different CEST effects was predicted with only small deviations (Pearson R = 0.89). The 9.4 T prediction was less noisy compared to the directly measured CEST maps, although at the cost of slightly lower tissue contrast. Application to an unseen tumor patient measured at 3 T and 9.4 T revealed that tumorous tissue Z-spectra and corresponding hyper-/hypointensities of different CEST effects can also be predicted (Pearson R = 0.84). Conclusion The 9.4 T CEST signals acquired at low saturation power can be accurately estimated from CEST imaging at 3 T using a neural network trained with coregistered 3 T and 9.4 T data of healthy subjects.

	abstract = {Purpose To improve whole-brain SNR at 7 Tesla, a novel 32-element hybrid human head array coil was developed, constructed, and tested. Methods Our general design strategy is based on 2 major ideas: Firstly, following suggestions of previous works based on the ultimate intrinsic SNR theory, we combined loops and dipoles for improvement of SNR near the head center. Secondly, we minimized the total number of array elements by using a hybrid combination of transceive (TxRx) and receive (Rx) elements. The new hybrid array consisted of 8 folded-end TxRx-dipole antennas and 3 rows of 24 Rx-loops all placed in a single layer on the surface of a tight-fit helmet. Results The developed array significantly improved SNR in vivo both near the center (∼20\%) and at the periphery (∼20\% to 80\%) in comparison to a common commercial array coil with 8 transmit (Tx) and 32 Rx-elements. Whereas 24 loops alone delivered central SNR very similar to that of the commercial coil, the addition of complementary dipole structures provided further improvement. The new array also provided ∼15\% higher Tx efficiency and better longitudinal coverage than that of the commercial array. Conclusion The developed array coil demonstrated advantages in combining complementary TxRx and Rx resonant structures, that is, TxRx-dipoles and Rx-loops all placed in a single layer at the same distance to the head. This strategy improved both SNR and Tx-performance, as well as simplified the total head coil design, making it more robust.},

	abstract = {Lithium metal anodes offer a huge leap in the energy density of batteries, yet their implementation is limited by solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and dendrite deposition. A key challenge in developing electrolytes leading to the SEI with beneficial properties is the lack of experimental approaches for directly probing the ionic permeability of the SEI. Here, we introduce lithium chemical exchange saturation transfer (Li-CEST) as an efficient nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) approach for detecting the otherwise invisible process of Li exchange across the metal–SEI interface. In Li-CEST, the properties of the undetectable SEI are encoded in the NMR signal of the metal resonance through their exchange process. We benefit from the high surface area of lithium dendrites and are able, for the first time, to detect exchange across solid phases through CEST. Analytical Bloch-McConnell models allow us to compare the SEI permeability formed in different electrolytes, making the presented Li-CEST approach a powerful tool for designing electrolytes for metal-based batteries.},

	abstract = {Purpose To investigate how electronically modulated time-varying receive sensitivities can improve parallel imaging reconstruction at ultra-high field. Methods Receive sensitivity modulation was achieved by introducing PIN diodes in the receive loops, which allow rapid switching of capacitances in both arms of each loop coil and by that alter B1− profiles, resulting in two distinct receive sensitivity configurations. A prototype 8-channel reconfigurable receive coil for human head imaging at 9.4T was built, and MR measurements were performed in both phantom and human subject. A modified SENSE reconstruction for time-varying sensitivities was formulated, and g-factor calculations were performed to investigate how modulation of receive sensitivity profiles during image encoding can improve parallel imaging reconstruction. The optimized modulation pattern was realized experimentally, and reconstructions with the time-varying sensitivities were compared with conventional static SENSE reconstructions. Results The g-factor calculations showed that fast modulation of receive sensitivities in the order of the ADC dwell time during k-space acquisition can improve parallel imaging performance, as this effectively makes spatial information of both configurations simultaneously available for image encoding. This was confirmed by in vivo measurements, for which lower reconstruction errors (SSIM = 0.81 for acceleration R = 4) and g-factors (max g = 2.4; R = 4) were observed for the case of rapidly switched sensitivities compared to conventional reconstruction with static sensitivities (SSIM = 0.74 and max g = 3.2; R = 4). As the method relies on the short RF wavelength at ultra-high field, it does not yield significant benefits at 3T and below. Conclusions Time-varying receive sensitivities can be achieved by inserting PIN diodes in the receive loop coils, which allow modulation of B1− patterns. This offers an additional degree of freedom for image encoding, with the potential for improved parallel imaging performance at ultra-high field.},

Methods We developed a deepCEST 7 T approach that generates CEST contrasts from just 1 scan with robustness against B1 inhomogeneities. The input data for a neural feed-forward network consisted of 7 T in vivo uncorrected Z-spectra of a single B1 level, and a B1 map. The 7 T raw data were acquired using a 3D snapshot gradient echo multiple interleaved mode saturation CEST sequence. These inputs were mapped voxel-wise to target data consisting of Lorentzian amplitudes generated conventionally by 5-pool Lorentzian fitting of normalized, denoised, B0- and B1-corrected Z-spectra. The deepCEST network was trained with Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss, providing an uncertainty quantification in addition to the Lorentzian amplitudes. Results The deepCEST 7 T network provides fast and accurate prediction of all Lorentzian parameters also when only a single B1 level is used. The prediction was highly accurate with respect to the Lorentzian fit amplitudes, and both healthy tissues and hyperintensities in tumor areas are predicted with a low uncertainty. In corrupted cases, high uncertainty indicated wrong predictions reliably. Conclusion The proposed deepCEST 7 T approach reduces scan time by 50\% to now 6:42 min, but still delivers both B0- and B1-corrected homogeneous CEST contrasts along with an uncertainty map, which can increase diagnostic confidence.

	abstract = {We propose to utilize the rich information content about microstructural tissue properties entangled in asymmetric balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) profiles to estimate multiple diffusion metrics simultaneously by neural network (NN) parameter quantification. A 12-point bSSFP phase-cycling scheme with high-resolution whole-brain coverage is employed at 3 and 9.4 T for NN input. Low-resolution target diffusion data are derived based on diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar-imaging (SE-EPI) scans, that is, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, AD, and RD), fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as the spherical coordinates (azimuth Φ and inclination ϴ) of the principal diffusion eigenvector. A feedforward NN is trained with incorporated probabilistic uncertainty estimation. The NN predictions yielded highly reliable results in white matter (WM) and gray matter structures for MD. The quantification of FA, AD, and RD was overall in good agreement with the reference but the dependence of these parameters on WM anisotropy was somewhat biased (e.g. in corpus callosum). The inclination ϴ was well predicted for anisotropic WM structures, while the azimuth Φ was overall poorly predicted. The findings were highly consistent across both field strengths. Application of the optimized NN to high-resolution input data provided whole-brain maps with rich structural details. In conclusion, the proposed NN-driven approach showed potential to provide distortion-free high-resolution whole-brain maps of multiple diffusion metrics at high to ultrahigh field strengths in clinically relevant scan times.},

	abstract = {Isolated evaluation of multiparametric in vivo chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI often requires complex computational processing for both correction of B0 and B1 inhomogeneity and contrast generation. For that, sufficiently densely sampled Z-spectra need to be acquired. The list of acquired frequency offsets largely determines the total CEST acquisition time, while potentially representing redundant information. In this work, a linear projection-based multiparametric CEST evaluation method is introduced that offers fast B0 and B1 inhomogeneity correction, contrast generation and feature selection for CEST data, enabling reduction of the overall measurement time. To that end, CEST data acquired at 7 T in six healthy subjects and in one brain tumor patient were conventionally evaluated by interpolation-based inhomogeneity correction and Lorentzian curve fitting. Linear regression was used to obtain coefficient vectors that directly map uncorrected data to corrected Lorentzian target parameters. L1-regularization was applied to find subsets of the originally acquired CEST measurements that still allow for such a linear projection mapping. The linear projection method allows fast and interpretable mapping from acquired raw data to contrast parameters of interest, generalizing from healthy subject training data to unseen healthy test data and to the tumor patient dataset. The L1-regularization method shows that a fraction of the acquired CEST measurements is sufficient to preserve tissue contrasts, offering up to a 2.8-fold reduction of scan time. Similar observations as for the 7-T data can be made for data from a clinical 3-T scanner. Being a fast and interpretable computation step, the proposed method is complementary to neural networks that have recently been employed for similar purposes. The scan time acceleration offered by the L1-regularization (“CEST-LASSO”) constitutes a step towards better applicability of multiparametric CEST protocols in a clinical context.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To improve transmit B1+ field homogeneity and longitudinal coverage of a human head RF array coil, we developed a novel eight-element transceiver (TxRx) array using composite elements based on paired folded-end dipoles.
Methods
The developed array consisted of eight pairs of coupled folded-end dipoles. Only one dipole in each pair was driven during transmission, while the other was passively coupled with the active one. The distribution of the transmit B1+ field was numerically optimized by changing the overlap between the dipoles and the value of the reactive lumped element placed in the middle of the passive dipole.
Results
The proposed array of paired folded-end dipoles substantially improved the B1+ homogeneity and longitudinal coverage over the entire brain including the brain stem compared to a single-row folded-end dipole array. The improved whole brain coverage was demonstrated both numerically and experimentally.
Conclusion
As a proof of concept, we developed and characterized both numerically and experimentally a prototype of a single-row eight-element 9.4 T array for human brain imaging consisting of composite array elements based on paired passively-coupled folded-end dipoles. The array improved the transmit magnetic field distribution due to the laterally elongated field pattern created by one active and one passive dipole per channel. As a result, the provided coverage was substantially better than that of an 8-element dipole array consisting of long folded-end dipoles. For the first time, an image of the entire human brain at 9.4 T, covering the brain stem up to the fourth vertebra, was obtained using a simple single row eight-element array.},

Results The developed eight-element coaxial dipole TxRx array coil showed up to 1.1times higher SAR-efficiency than a similar in geometry folded-end and fractionated dipole array while maintaining whole brain coverage and low sensitivity of the resonance frequency to variation in the head size. Conclusion As a proof of concept, we developed and constructed a prototype of a 9.4T (400 MHz) human head array consisting of eight TxRx coaxial dipoles. The developed array improved SAR-efficiency and provided for a more compact and robust alternative to the folded-end dipole design.

	abstract = {Objective Low-field magnetic resonance imaging is currently developing into a valuable diagnostic tool due to its simplicity of magnet array designs. Particularly, this allows the development of scanners as part of educational workshops, thus ensuring knowledge transfer and empowering local scientists to design tailored solutions for specific local problems. To obtain the maximum performance, the magnet needs to be shimmed requiring an automated system measuring the spatial magnetic field distribution.
Methods A self-designed measuring probe based on commercial integrated Hall sensor chips is used and optimized by calibrating it in an easy-to-build calibration system. For positioning of the sensor, a low-cost five-degree-of-freedom robot arm is used and improved by camera-based motion tracking for precise localization of the sensor.
Results The system is able to map the field of a 45mT-Halbach desktop MR magnet, as well as a self-designed x-gradient (used inside the magnet) with an efficiency of 2mT∕m∕A. The built-up Hall sensor demonstrates a level of precision that is competitive with commercial sensors. The entire positioning system can be freely scaled to accommodate larger designs by adjusting the kinematics.
Conclusion The presented system is demonstrated to be comparable to already established measurement systems, while the costs, setup times, and mapping duration are greatly reduced.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate dipole antennas with electronically switchable transmit field patterns to improve flip angle homogeneity in ultra-high field MRI Methods: An array of eight coaxial dipoles with electronically switchable \$B\_\{1\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}!+\}\$ field profiles was constructed. Alteration of the field profiles was accomplished by modulating the currents along the dipoles using a combination of PIN diodes and lumped inductances. The behavior of these reconfigurable elements was studied in numerical electromagnetic simulations and 9.4T MRI measurements, investigating rapid switching of transmit sensitivities during excitation pulses in both single-channel and pTx mode operation. Results: For the simulated dipole elements, modulating the current densities along the dipole's axis causes a \${\textbackslash}sim\$30\% change of the \$B\_\{1\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}!+\}\$ field between superior and inferior regions of the brain. When rapidly switched during excitation pulses, this degree of freedom can improve flip angle homogeneity, e.g. by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim\$2.2 for a two kT points pTx pulse. For the constructed prototype array, the switching effect was observable but weaker, causing \${\textbackslash}sim\$10\% superior-inferior \$B\_\{1\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}!+\}\$ variation. Conclusion: The proposed coaxial dipole array with switchable transmit sensitivities offers a novel degree of freedom for designing excitation pulses. The approach has the potential to improve flip angle homogeneity without necessitating an expensive increase in the number of independent transmit channels.},

	abstract = {Purpose MRI systems are traditionally engineered to produce close to idealized performance, enabling a simplified pulse sequence design philosophy. An example of this is control of eddy currents produced by gradient fields; usually these are compensated by pre-emphasizing demanded waveforms. This process typically happens invisibly to the pulse sequence designer, allowing them to assume achieved gradient waveforms will be as desired. Although convenient, this requires system specifications exposed to the end user to be substantially down-rated, as pre-emphasis adds an extra overhead to the waveforms. This strategy is undesirable for lower performance or resource-limited hardware. Instead, we propose an optimization-based method to design precompensated gradient waveforms that (i) explicitly respect hardware constraints and (ii) improve imaging performance by correcting k-space samples directly. Methods Gradient waveforms are numerically optimized by including a model for system imperfections. This is investigated in simulation using an exponential eddy current model, then experimentally using an empirical gradient system transfer function on a 7T MRI system. Results Our proposed method discovers solutions that produce negligible reconstruction errors while satisfying gradient system limits, even when classic pre-emphasis produces infeasible results. Substantial reduction in ghosting artifacts from echo-planar imaging was observed, including an average reduction of 77\% in ghost amplitude in phantoms. Conclusions This work demonstrates numerical optimization of gradient waveforms, yielding substantially improved image quality when given a model for system imperfections. Although the method as implemented has limited flexibility, it could enable more efficient hardware use and may prove particularly important for maximizing performance of lower-cost systems.},

	abstract = {Parallel imaging is one of the key MRI technologies that allow reduction of image acquisition time. However, the parallel imaging reconstruction commonly leads to a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) drop evaluated using a so-called geometrical factor (g-factor). The g-factor is minimized by increasing the number of array elements and their spatial diversity. At the same time, increasing the element count requires a decrease in their size. This may lead to insufficient coil loading, an increase in the relative noise contribution from the RF coil itself, and hence SNR reduction. Previously, instead of increasing the channel number, we introduced the concept of electronically switchable time-varying sensitivities, which was shown to improve parallel imaging performance. In this approach, each reconfigurable receive element supports two spatially distinct sensitivity profiles. In this work, we developed and evaluated a novel eight-element human head receive-only reconfigurable coaxial dipole array for human head imaging at 9.4 T. In contrast to the previously reported reconfigurable dipole array, the new design does not include direct current (DC) control wires connected directly to the dipoles. The coaxial cable itself is used to deliver DC voltage to the PIN diodes located at the ends of the antennas. Thus, the novel reconfigurable coaxial dipole design opens a way to scale the dynamic parallel imaging up to a realistic number of channels, that is, 32 and above. The novel array was optimized and tested experimentally, including in vivo studies. It was found that dynamic sensitivity switching provided an 8\% lower mean and 33\% lower maximum g-factor (for Ry × Rz = 2 × 2 acceleration) compared with conventional static sensitivities.},

	abstract = {Homogeneity and longitudinal coverage of transmit (Tx) human head RF coils at ultrahigh field (UHF, ≥7 T) can be improved by 3D RF shimming, which requires using multi-row Tx arrays. Examples of 3D RF shimming using double-row UHF loop transceiver (TxRx) and Tx arrays have been described previously. Dipole antennas provide unique simplicity and robustness while offering comparable Tx efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio to conventional loop designs. Single-row Tx and TxRx human head UHF dipole arrays have been previously described by multiple groups. Recently, we developed a novel type of dipole antenna, a folded-end dipole, and presented single-row eight-element array prototypes for human head imaging at 7 and 9.4 T. These studies have shown that the novel antenna design can improve the longitudinal coverage and minimize peak local specific absorption rate (SAR) as compared with common unfolded dipoles. In this work, we developed, constructed, and evaluated a 16-element double-row TxRx folded-end dipole array for human head imaging at 9.4 T. To minimize cross-talk between neighboring dipoles located in different rows, we used transformer decoupling, which decreased coupling to a level below −20 dB. The developed array design was demonstrated to be capable of 3D static RF shimming and can be potentially used for dynamic shimming using parallel transmission. For optimal phase shifts between the rows, the array provides 11\% higher SAR efficiency and 18\% higher homogeneity than a folded-end dipole single-row array of the same length. The design also offers a substantially simpler and more robust alternative to the common double-row loop array with about 10\% higher SAR efficiency and better longitudinal coverage.},
