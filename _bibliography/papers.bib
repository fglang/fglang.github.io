	abstract = {Purpose An end-to-end differentiable 2D Bloch simulation is used to reduce T2 induced blurring in single-shot turbo spin echo sequences, also called rapid imaging with refocused echoes (RARE) sequences, by using a joint optimization of refocusing flip angles and a convolutional neural network. Methods Simulation and optimization were performed in the MR-zero framework. Variable flip angle train and DenseNet parameters were optimized jointly using the instantaneous transverse magnetization, available in our simulation, at a certain echo time, which serves as ideal blurring-free target. Final optimized sequences were exported for in vivo measurements at a real system (3 T Siemens, PRISMA) using the Pulseq standard. Results The optimized RARE was able to successfully lower T2-induced blurring for single-shot RARE sequences in proton density-weighted and T2-weighted images. In addition to an increased sharpness, the neural network allowed correction of the contrast changes to match the theoretical transversal magnetization. The optimization found flip angle design strategies similar to existing literature, however, visual inspection of the images and evaluation of the respective point spread function demonstrated an improved performance. Conclusions This work demonstrates that when variable flip angles and a convolutional neural network are optimized jointly in an end-to-end approach, sequences with more efficient minimization of T2-induced blurring can be found. This allows faster single- or multi-shot RARE MRI with longer echo trains.},

	abstract = {Purpose To extend the concept of 3D dynamic parallel imaging, we developed a prototype of an electronically reconfigurable dipole array that provides sensitivity alteration along the dipole length. Methods We developed a radiofrequency array coil consisting of eight reconfigurable elevated-end dipole antennas. The receive sensitivity profile of each dipole can be electronically shifted toward one or the other end by electrical shortening or lengthening the dipole arms using positive-intrinsic-negative-diode lump-element switching units. Based on the results of electromagnetic simulations, we built the prototype and tested it at 9.4 T on phantom and healthy volunteer. A modified 3D SENSE reconstruction was used, and geometry factor (g-factor) calculations were performed to assess the new array coil. Results Electromagnetic simulations showed that the new array coil was capable of alteration of its receive sensitivity profile along the dipole length. Electromagnetic and g-factor simulations showed closely agreeing predictions when compared to the measurements. The new dynamically reconfigurable dipole array provided significant improvement in geometry factor compared to static dipoles. We obtained up to 220\% improvement for 3 × 2 (Ry × Rz) acceleration compared to the static configuration case in terms of maximum g-factor and up to 54\% in terms of mean g-factor for the same acceleration. Conclusion We presented an 8-element prototype of a novel electronically reconfigurable dipole receive array that permits rapid sensitivity modulations along the dipole axes. Applying dynamic sensitivity modulation during image acquisition emulates two virtual rows of receive elements along the z-direction, and therefore improves parallel imaging performance for 3D acquisitions.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A framework for supervised design of MR sequences for any given target contrast is proposed, based on fully automatic acquisition and reconstruction of MR data on a real MR scanner. The proposed method does not require any modeling of MR physics and thus allows even unknown contrast mechanisms to be addressed.
Methods: A derivative-free optimization algorithm is set up to repeatedly update and execute a parametrized sequence on the MR scanner to acquire data. In each iteration, the acquired data are mapped to a given target contrast by linear regression.
Results: It is shown that with the proposed framework it is possible to ﬁnd an MR sequence that yields a predeﬁned target contrast. In the present case, as a proof-of principle, a sequence mapping absolute creatine concentration, which cannot be extracted from T1 or T2-weighted scans directly, is discovered. The sequence was designed in a comparatively short time and with no human interaction.
Conclusions: New MR contrasts for mapping a given target can be discovered by derivative-free optimization of parametrized sequences that are directly executed on a real MRI scanner. This is demonstrated by ‘re-discovery’ of a chemical exchange weighted sequence. The proposed method is considered to be a paradigm shift towards autonomous, model-free and target-driven sequence design.},
